I'm Jesse Langford, a software engineer based in Hong Kong. Before I started writing code, I spent five years as a golf instructor, teaching in various locations across the U.S. and Beijing. In 2015, I made a career shift, trading fairways for frameworks to pursue my long-standing interest in technology.

Since then, I've designed and built a range of web applications and system integrations for both startups and established teams. My work combines a coach’s clarity with a developer’s precision—skills I've honed over years of both instruction and engineering.

As a passion project, I write technical articles and how-to guides that aim to demystify software development for fellow engineers. My writing focuses on practical topics ranging from backend systems to security and developer tools.

I currently live in Hong Kong, where I code, write, and occasionally still work on my swing.
