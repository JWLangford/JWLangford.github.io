**Jesse Langford** is a software engineer based in Hong Kong. Before writing code, he spent five years as a golf instructor, teaching in various locations across the U.S. and Beijing. In 2015, he made a career shift, trading fairways for frameworks to pursue his long-standing interest in technology.

Since then, he has designed and built a range of web applications and system integrations for startups and established teams alike. His work combines a coach’s clarity with a developer’s precision—skills honed over years of both instruction and engineering.

As a passion project, Jesse writes technical articles and how-to guides that aim to demystify software development for fellow engineers. His writing focuses on practical topics ranging from backend systems to security and developer tools.

He currently lives in Hong Kong, where he codes, writes, and occasionally still works on his swing.
